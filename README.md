🏢 Hostel Management System
🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the Hostel Management System project! This system aims to streamline the management of hostel accommodations for university students. It provides features for student registration, room reservation, and fee management.

📚 Case Study
The D24 Hostel, located in Colombo, accommodates university students from various campuses. With a capacity for 125 students, the hostel caters to both genders. However, manual record-keeping has become inefficient with the increasing number of students.

To address this issue, a system is needed for student registration and fee management. The process involves:

🏫 Student visits for room reservation and undergoes a simple interview.
👨‍💼 Employee checks room availability and initiates the registration process.
📋 Details about the student, registration date, and room type are recorded.
💵 Student pays key money for the room or promises to pay later.
🆔 Each student registers with their campus ID.
